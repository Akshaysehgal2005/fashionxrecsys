							<h2>First Workshop on Fashion Recommendations for e-commerce and  Retail (#fashionXrecsys)</h2>
							<p>Copenhagen, Denmark, 16th September 2019</p>
						
								<p>Online Fashion retailers have significantly increased in popularity over the last decade, making it possible for customers to explore hundreds of thousands of products without the need to visit multiple stores or stand in long queues for checkout. However, the customers still face several hurdles with current online shopping solutions.  For example, customers often feel overwhelmed with the large selection of the assortment and brands. In addition, there is still a lack of effective suggestions capable of satisfying customers’ style preferences, or size and fit needs, necessary to enable them in their decision-making process. Moreover, in recent years social shopping in fashion has surfaced, thanks to platforms such as Instagram, providing a very interesting opportunity that allows to explore fashion in radically new ways. Such recent developments provides exciting challenges for Recommender Systems and Machine Learning research communities.
								</p>

								<p>The First fashionXrecsys workshop aims to engage the recommender systems community, spanning both academic and industrial backgrounds, in meaningful discussion about the use of recommender systems and machine learning to solve important challenges and opportunities in the area of fashion e-commerce and retail.</p>

							<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in the fashion, recommendations and machine learning domains to discuss open problems in the aforementioned areas. This involves addressing interdisciplinary problems with all of the challenges it entails. Within this workshop we aim to start the conversation among professionals in the fashion and e-commerce industries and recommender systems scientists, and create a new space for collaboration between these communities necessary for tackling these deep problems. To provide rich opportunities to share opinions and experience in such an emerging field, we will accept paper submissions on established and novel ideas, as well as new interactive participation formats.</p>

							<p> Suggested topics for submissions are (but not limited to): </p>
							<ul>
							<li>Computer vision in Fashion (image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection)</li>
							<li>Deep learning in recommendation systems for Fashion</li>
							<li>Learning and application of fashion style (personalized style, implicit and explicit preferences, budget, social behaviour, etc) </li>
							<li>Size and Fit recommendations through mining customers implicit and explicit size and fit preferences.</li>
							<li>Modelling articles and brands size and fit similarity.</li>
							<li>Usage of ontologies and article metadata in fashion and retail (NLP, social mining, search)</li>
							<li>Addressing cold-start problem both for items and users in fashion recommendation</li>
							<li>Knowledge transfer in multi-domain fashion recommendation systems</li>
							<li>Hybrid recommendations on customers’ history and on-line behavior</li>
