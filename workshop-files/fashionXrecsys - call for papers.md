# CFP: Workshop on Recommender Systems in Fashion & Retail,
###In conjunction with ACM RecSys 2019, Copenhagen, Denmark, 19th-20th September 2019


Online Fashion retailers have significantly increased in popularity over the last decade, making it possible for customers to explore hundreds of thousands of products without the need to visit multiple stores or stand in long queues for checkout. However, the customers still face several hurdles with current online shopping solutions. For example, customers often feel overwhelmed with the large selection of the assortment and brands. In addition, there is still a lack of effective suggestions capable of satisfying customers’ style preferences, or size and fit needs, necessary to enable them in their decision-making process.  In this context, recommender systems are very well positioned to play a crucial role in creating a great customer experience in fashion. Moreover, in recent years social shopping in fashion has surfaced, thanks to platforms such as Instagram, providing a very interesting opportunity that allows to explore fashion in radically new ways. Such recent developments provides exciting challenges for the Recommender Systems and Machine Learning research communities.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in the fashion, recommendations and machine learning domains to discuss open problems in the aforementioned areas. This involves addressing interdisciplinary problems with all of the challenges it entails. Within this workshop we aim to start the conversation among professionals in the fashion and e-commerce industries and recommender systems scientists, and create a new space for collaboration between these communities necessary for tackling these deep problems. To provide rich opportunities to share opinions and experience in such an emerging field, we will accept paper submissions on established and novel ideas, as well as new interactive participation formats.

### Suggested topics for submissions are (but not limited to):

- Computer vision in Fashion (image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection)
- Deep learning in recommendation systems for Fashion
- Learning and application of fashion style (personalized style, implicit and explicit preferences, budget, social behaviour, etc)
- Size and Fit recommendations through mining customers implicit and explicit size and fit preferences
- Modelling articles and brands size and fit similarity
- Usage of ontologies and article metadata in fashion and retail (NLP, social mining, search)
- Addressing cold-start problem both for items and users in fashion recommendation
- Knowledge transfer in multi-domain fashion recommendation systems
- Hybrid recommendations on customers’ history and on-line behavior
- Multi- or Cross- domain recommendations (social media and online shops)
- Privacy preserving techniques for customer’s preferences tracing
- Understanding social and psychological factors and impacts of influence on users’ fashion choices (such as Instagram, influencers, etc.)

### Paper Submission Instructions

- All submissions and reviews will be handled electronically via EasyChair at the following address: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=
Papers must be submitted by 23:59, AoE (Anywhere on Earth) on July 1st, 2019
- Submissions should be prepared according to the standard double-column ACM SIG proceedings format according to the standard double-column ACM SIG proceedings format.
The ideal length of a paper is between 4-8 pages, but submissions have no strict page limits. Although the authors should avoid submitting unnecessarily long papers in order not to overwhelm reviewers.

- The peer review process is double-blind (i.e. anonymised). This means that all submissions must not include information identifying the authors or their organisation. Specifically, do not include the authors’ names and affiliations, anonymise citations to your previous work and avoid providing any other information that would allow to identify the authors, such as acknowledgments and funding. However, that it is acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions, if specifically necessary for understanding the work described in the paper.
- Submitted work should be original. However, technical reports or ArXiv disclosure prior to or simultaneous with the workshop submission, is allowed, provided they are not peer-reviewed. The organizers also encourage authors to make their code and datasets publicly available.

- Accepted papers are given an oral and a poster presentation slot at the workshop. At least one author of every accepted paper must attend the workshop and present their work. Please contact the workshop organization if none of the authors will be able to attend the workshop-
- All accepted papers will be available through the program website which will be linked from the official RecSys‘19 site. Moreover, selected authors will be invited to contribute an extended version of their paper to be published in a Journal.
